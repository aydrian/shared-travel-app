# ‚úàÔ∏è Shared Travel App

RBAC and ReBAC authorization demo using Oso Cloud

## üöÄ Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/aydrian/ai-driven-authz-demo.git
   cd ai-driven-authz-demo
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```shell
   bun install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   ```shell
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit the `.env` file and fill in the required values:

   - `DATABASE_URL`: Your PostgreSQL database URL. If you're using the provided Docker setup, use:
     ```
     DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/shared_travel_app
     ```
   - `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`: A secret key for Better Auth
   - `BETTER_AUTH_URL`: The URL for Better Auth (default is http://localhost:3000)

4. Start the database using Docker:

   ```shell
   bun run docker:up
   ```

   This command starts a PostgreSQL database in a Docker container with the following configuration:

   - Username: postgres
   - Password: password
   - Database: shared_travel_app
   - Port: 5432

5. Set up the database schema:

   ```shell
   bun run db:push
   ```

6. Seed the database:

   ```shell
   bun run db:seed
   ```

7. Start the development server:

   ```shell
   bun run dev
   ```

## üê≥ Docker

The project uses Docker to run the PostgreSQL database. The configuration is defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

You can customize the database settings by modifying the following environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
environment:
  POSTGRES_USER: postgres
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
  POSTGRES_DB: shared_travel_app
```

You can also change the port mapping if needed:

```yaml
ports:
  - 5432:5432
```

After making changes to the `docker-compose.yml` file, make sure to update your `.env` file with the corresponding `DATABASE_URL`.

To manage the Docker container:

1. Start the database:

   ```shell
   bun run docker:up
   ```

2. To stop the database:

   ```shell
   bun run docker:down
   ```

3. To remove the database container and volumes:

   ```shell
   bun run docker:clean
   ```

Make sure the database is running before performing any database operations or starting the application.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Management

This project uses [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) for database operations and schema management. Here are some useful commands for managing your database:

- Generate migration files:

  ```shell
  bun run db:generate
  ```

- Apply migrations:

  ```shell
  bun run db:migrate
  ```

- Open Drizzle Studio for visual database management:

  ```shell
  bun run db:studio
  ```

Drizzle ORM provides type-safe database queries and schema definitions. For more information on how to use Drizzle ORM in your project, refer to the [Drizzle ORM documentation](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/overview).
