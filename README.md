## üóÑÔ∏è Database Management

TThis project uses [Cloudflare D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/) as the database, which is a serverless SQL database. We use [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) for database operations and schema management. Here are some useful commands for managing your database:

- Generate migration files:

  ```shell
  bun run db:generate
  ```

- Apply migrations:

  ```shell
  bun run db:migrate
  ```

- Open Drizzle Studio for visual database management:

  ```shell
  bun run db:studio
  ```

Drizzle ORM provides type-safe database queries and schema definitions. For more information on how to use Drizzle ORM in your project, refer to the [Drizzle ORM documentation](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/overview).

For more information about Cloudflare D1, refer to the [Cloudflare D1 documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/).
